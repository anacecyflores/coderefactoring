# coderefactoring

## Description

- The goal of refactoring this website was to bring the code up to accessibility standards and use meaningful elements that follow html order.
- I edited the code and updated the css elements to ensure all elements were functional and user-friendly.
- The client will have a working website that follows the accessibility standards, have a better user experience with all elements working correctly as well as re-grouping the previous code into a clean and sequential code that can easily be read and updated in the future b y anyone who opens it.
- I learned how to create classes to group elements better and have concise code if they all follow the same rules. I learned how to implement html and css basics. The most important piece I learned by doing this assignment was that you must always use meaningful elements than create random divisions. Understanding this piece will become significant in future projects since as a coder you must not only be able to understand the purpose of the elements, but also to determine the best way to group them.
